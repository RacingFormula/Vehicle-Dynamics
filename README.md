# Vehicle Dynamics

This repository organises projects focused on vehicle dynamics in motorsport. From straight-line acceleration to cornering stability, these projects explore the key factors influencing vehicle performance.

## Projects

### 1. [Longitudinal Dynamics Model](#)
Simulates straight-line acceleration, braking, and drag effects on vehicle performance.

### 2. [Lateral Dynamics Model](#)
Models cornering dynamics, including stability, tyre grip, and lateral forces.

### 3. [Suspension Performance Analyser](#)
Analyses the impact of suspension setup on ride quality and handling characteristics.

### 4. [Aerodynamic Efficiency Simulator](#)
Explores the effects of drag and downforce on speed and lap times.

### 5. [Tyre Energy Dissipation Model](#)
Simulates energy loss through rolling resistance, lateral forces, and tyre deformation.

## Usage

Each project contains its own README with detailed information and usage instructions.
